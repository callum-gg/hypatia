This is the default output folder for all visualization scripts.

To run visualisations, run the webserver:

`python webserver.py`

This will start a webserver on port 8000 (which can be easily modified in the script). This is necessary to run the visualisation webpages (as they cannot be viewed as just files in your browser).
